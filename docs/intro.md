# Welcome To Alkimi Exchange

A decentralised replacement to the inefficient legacy programmatic ad exchanges with the mission to restore the value exchange between advertisers, publishers and users.

Alkimi is powered by the Hypergraph – a revolutionary blockchain technology – trusted by the U.S. Department of Defense – which allows us to provide the fastest, infinitely scalable solution with 0% fraud, minimal transaction fees and complete end to end transparency.

Alkimi Exchange helps you create ad products, proven to be successful by walled gardens, across the open web.

## The Worlds First Decentralised Ad Exchange

We think about Advertising differently, so we are building the world’s first decentralised ad exchange, where:

- Users aren't a product
- Publishers aren't at the behest of Facebook and Google
- Advertisers can deliver their message with value

Using the principle of Generative Economics, the Alkimi Exchange will reward Users, Publishers and Advertisers for rebuilding the intended value exchange of the Open Web. Fewer Ads, Better User Experience, Increased Engagement.

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
